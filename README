guile-json: A basic JSON parser for Guile

This is a json parser for Guile that I hacked together in ~3 hours (well, it's gone up since then), it's still a bit rough around the edges, but if your json is valid it should handle it fine.

INSTALLATION:

* Downloads/Instructions coming soon

TO-DO:

* Comments?
* Clean up json-writer, a lot. It has some ugly output ([ [4, 5], [6, {'foo': 7} ] ] becomes [[4,5,],[6,{'foo':7,},],]
* Fix data destruction of \u escapes (see BUGS)
* Make error handling a bit more helpful

BUGS:

* Guile integer->char only supports ASCII, as such any unicode escape >00FF will get converted to 00FF to prevent errors. This may be fixed at some point
* Guile's "null" is an empty list, so json's null is represented as a function json:null so you can test for equality.
* Essentially chokes on any invalid input
* Probably more
